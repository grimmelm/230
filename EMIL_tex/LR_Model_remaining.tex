\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prohibition}: If society bans widgets, it compels the factory to set $\hat{x} = 0$ and make a profit of $0$. But since $0 < x^e$, social welfare will be less than the efficient level. For some values of $h$ and $p$, prohibition will be better than no liability; for others, it will be worse.
\item \textbf{Negligence}: The regulator sets a threshold $t$. The platform faces no liability for content below that threshold, but is liable for the harms caused by production above that threshold. It is a standard law-and-economics result that setting $t = x^e$ gives the platform the same incentives as strict liability. Setting $t < x^e$ also produces the right marginal incentives at $x^e$, but can cause the factory to fail in some cases where it cannot cover its fixed costs $F$.

\subsection{Strict Liability}





\subsection{Blanket Immunity}









Figure~\ref{fig:factory} illustrates social welfare as a function of the factory's output. The net benefit or harm to society from the factory's production at $x$ is given between the signed difference between $p(x)$ and $h(x)$. To the left of the point at which $p$ and $h$ cross, where $p(x) > h(x)$, is net beneficial. Although there are harms from pollution, they are outweighed by the value of the corresponding widgets. Production beyond that point, where $p(x) < h(x)$, is net harmful. Here, the harms from pollution are worse than the value of the corresponding widgets; society would be better off if these widgets were not produced at all. The socially efficient outcome, which we denote $x^e$, occurs when $p(x) = h(x)$. 



This is the standard law-and-economics case for strict liability: it is automatically efficient provided that courts can accurately assess the harms caused by the defendant. Negligence and reasonable efforts can also achieve efficiency, but they faces the additional burden of also requiring that the regulator or court chooses the liability threshold correctly. As we will see, one of the essential assumptions of this argument fails for platforms.

%%% XXX Table of liability regimes and factory's marginal profit functions

%%%Instead, free speech law typically follows the negligence strategy of defining an objective standard of care that a reasonable person is expected to follow when acting. One who acts according to that standard of care faces no liability, even if others are harmed. But one who fails to meet that standard is held liable for the resulting harms. In our model, this approach corresponds to defining a threshold of liability $t$ and subjecting the actor to marginal liability:
\begin{equation}
\lt\{\begin{array}{ll}
	0 & \mbox{for $x <t$}, \\
	h(x) & \mbox{for $x \ge t$}.
\end{array}\rt.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Positive Externalities}

A key assumption of the polluting-factory model was that the factory captures all of the social benefit from widget production. There are good reasons to believe that this assumption fails for platforms. In fact, for many platforms it fails twice over.

 Now our factory produces content at a level $\hat{x} \in [0,n]$. As before, it has  marginal profit $p(x)$ and the content causes harms $h(x)$, with the same assumptions on $p(x)$ and $h(x)$. But now we let the positive externalities  of the content be $\delta(x)$, where $\delta(x)$ is weakly decreasing and always positive or zero.\footnote{It may seem artificial to separate $\delta(x)$ and $h(x)$; the reasons will be apparent soon.} We retain the condition that there is still some unambiguously harmful content -- i..e., $h(n) > p(n) + \delta(n)$. The factory's profit function (if it operates) is still 
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\hat{x}} p(x) dx - F
\end{equation}
but now total social welfare is given by
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\hat{x}} p(x) + \delta(x) - h(x) dx - F.
\end{equation}
Now consider the effects of possible regulations.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Blanket Immunity}: As above, the factory will set $\hat{x}$ such that $p(\hat{x}) = 0$. But now instead of this \emph{definitely} being overproduction, it is ambiguous. If $h(\hat{x}) > \delta(\hat{x})$, then the factory is overproducing content. But if  $h(\hat{x}) > \delta(\hat{x})$, it will underproduce. If this is efficient, it is fortuitously so.
	\item \textbf{Prohibition}: As above t/k
	\item \textbf{Must-Carry}: As above t/k
	\item \textbf{Strict Liability}: Under strict liability, the factory's marginal profit is $p(x) - h(x)$, so it will produce up to $x^*$ such that $p(x^*) = h(x^*)$. But this is now guaranteed to be underproduction, because the presence of the $\delta(x)$ term now means that $x^e$ is such that $p(x^e) + \delta(x^e) = h(x^e)$.
	 \item \textbf{Negligence}: This regime will be efficient if the regulator sets $t = x^e$.
	 \item \textbf{Reasonable Efforts}: This regime will be efficient if the regulator sets $T$ corresponding to $t$ as above. t/k
\end{itemize}



The difference is that in addition to the platform's revenue $P$, each unit of content that the platform chooses to host also generates an externality of  $\delta \ge 0$ for society at large. Like $P$, we assume that $\delta$ is constant across all content. Thus, while each unit of widget production generates $P$ in marginal profit for the factory, each unit of speech generates $P$ in value for the speaker and $\delta$ in value for society at large, for a total of $P + \delta$.\footnote{We assume that $H < P + \delta$, because otherwise it is socially optimal to maximize speech production, and a blanket immunity is always efficient, even for content known with complete certainty to be harmful.} Now the diagram looks like Figure~\ref{fig:speech}.

The efficient level of speech $x^e$ is defined not by where $H\lambda(x)$ intersects the speaker's marginal profit curve $P$ but by where it intersects society's marginal benefit curve $P+\delta$. That is, $x^e$ is such that $\lambda(x^e) = \frac{P+\delta}{H}$, which is strictly greater than $x^e$ in the non-speech case (i.e., where $\delta=0$). So the spillover benefits of speech mean that it is socially optimal to host more speech than in the case where there are no spillovers.

Now consider the liability regimes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Blanket Immunity}: The platform will host all content. This is still inefficient because it includes the net-harmful content at $x > x^e$ (in the red area in Figure~\ref{fig:speech}).
	 \item \textbf{Prohibition}: The platform will host no content. This is still inefficient because it foregoes the net-beneficial content at $x < x^e$ (in the green, blue, and yellow areas in Figure~\ref{fig:speech}). Compared with the non-speech case, prohibition is less likely to be better than blanket immunity, but which is superior depends on $P$, $H$, $\delta$, and $\lambda(x)$.
	 \item \textbf{Strict Liability}: The speaker will produce speech up to $x^*$ where $H\lambda(x^*) = P$. But because $P + \delta > P$ and $\lambda(x)$ is a weakly increasing function, $x^* \le x^e$. Pictorially, the platform will produce up to $x^*$, generating profits in the green region and spillover social benefits in the blue region. But there it will stop, even though the speech from $x^*$ to $x^e$ would have been beneficial to society: the yellow region represents foregone social welfare. Strict liability is strictly better than prohibition, which also gives up the green and blue regions. Whether strict liability is better than full immunity is indeterminate without more constraints on $H$, $P$, $\delta$, and $\lambda(x)$. The yellow region could be larger than the red, or vice versa.
	 \item \textbf{Negligence}: If the negligence threshold is set at $t=x^e$, then the platform's incentives again align with social welfare.\footnote{Cooter, prices and sanctions} Because the threshold is at $x^e$, the platform has no reason not to host content for $x < x^e$. But because $H > P$, any profit the platform makes from hosting content for $x >  x^e$ will be more than outweighed by the damages it must pay. So the platform will stop exactly at $x^e$, the social optimum.
\end{itemize} 

If the platform is given a legal incentive to remove harmful content, the best it can do is to remove \emph{all} content beyond a threshold of expected harm, which includes both harmful and harmless content.  A strict liability scheme does not take into account the positive spillover benefits to society of harmless content that \emph{from the platform's perspective} is equally likely \emph{ex ante} to be harmful as the harmful content it removes.

On the one hand, the profit it makes from each additional widget 

The factory earns a constant revenue for each widget it makes. But the more widgets it makes, the greater the probability that each additional widget is defective and harms the consumer who buys it. (For example, the widget-stamping machine might work perfectly at the start of a production run, but gradually deteriorate, so that eventually every widget it makes is defective.) The amount of harm caused by a defective widget is constant, and the factory can tell how likely a widget is to be defective but not which specific widgets are defective, and the factory can and does make the more-likely-to-good widgets first.


We assume that $H > P$.\footnote{In the case where $H \le P$, it is socially optimal for the factory to maximize production, so the only question for a legal regime is how to allocate the costs and benefits of widget production.} Let the probability that a given widget is defective be $\lambda(x)$ for $x \in [0,n]$, where $\lambda(x)$ is a weakly increasing function (i.e. $x < y$ implies $h(x) \le h(y)$). For simplicity of exposition, we assume that some widgets are known to be good (i.e. $\lambda(0) = 0$), and that some widgets are known to be defective (i.e. $\lambda(n) = 1$). 

For example, if $P = \$100$ and $H = \$200$, then $\lambda(\hat{x}) = \frac{1}{2}$, i.e., society is best off if the factory shuts down widget production when exactly half of the widgets coming off the line are defective. At this level of production, every widget the factory produces is likely to be beneficial; every widget it foregoes is likely to be harmful.

% But now we add a second dimension: each item of content is a pair $(x,y)$.  The $x$ axis measures harmfulness $h(x)$, as before. But the $y$ axis, which ranges from $0$ to $m$, measures the \emph{fraction} of content that is harmful. That is, for content at $(x,y)$, a fraction $\lambda(y)$ of that content is harmful and generates harm $h(x)$ per unit and a fraction $ 1- \lambda(y)$ is harmless and generates $0$ harm. The speaker of an item of content knows whether it is harmful or not, as does the regulator, but the platform does not. Instead, the platform observes the \emph{probability} $\lambda(y)$ that the item is harmful, where $\lambda(y)$ is a weakly increasing function of $y$, with $\lambda(0) = 0$. That is, the harmfulness $h(x,y)$ of content $(x,y)$ is given by:
% \begin{equation}
% h(x,y)=
% \lt\{\begin{array}{ll}
%     h(x) & \mbox{with probability $\lambda(y)$}, \\
%     0 & \mbox{with probability $1 - \lambda(y)$}.
% \end{array}\rt.
% \end{equation}
% In expectation, a unit of content at $y$ will generate harm $\lambda(y)h(x)$. Start by examining the platform's incentives. Hold $x$ fixed (so that $h(x)$ is constant and consider the following diagram of benefits and harms as as a function of $y$:

% Observe that the curve $\lambda(y)$ has \emph{exactly the same shape} as $h(x)$ did in the previous diagram. We have replaced a deterministic but variable harm $h(x)$ with a probabilistic but fixed harm $\lambda(y)h(x)$. This means that the analysis from the previous model carries over: if the platform chooses to allow content $y$ to remain up, it generates private value $P$ per unit, social value $P+S+\delta$ per unit, and \emph{expected} harm $h(x,y) = \lambda(y)h(x)$ per unit. As long as the platform's potential liability is a weakly increasing function in $y$, it will choose a threshold $\hat{y}$ that maximizes its profits by taking down all content $y > \hat{y}$ beyond the threshold and leaving up all content $y \le \hat{y}$. And as before, there is a socially efficient choice $y^e$, determined by $\lambda(y^e) = \frac{P + S+ \delta}{H}$, at which the platform takes up all and only that content whose expected harms exceed its social value. 

% As before, complete immunity leads to undermoderation because the platform sets $\hat{y} = m$, allowing expected net-harmful content to remain. Prohibition leads to overmoderation because the platform sets $\hat{y} = 0$, taking down expected net-beneficial content. Strict liability leads the platform to overmoderate (although less than for prohibition) because the platform sets $\hat{y} = y^{\ast}$ defined by $\lambda(y^{\ast} = \frac{P}{H})$, and $y^{\ast} \le y^e$. Threshold liability is efficient when the threshold is set at $y^e$. The regulator takes into account the value to speakers and society at large of speech.

% What is different about this model is that the \emph{platform}'s incentives are different than the \emph{speaker}'s. In particular, because speakers have perfect information along the $y$ axis about whether their content is harmful or not, they have an option the platform does not: to omit the harmful speech while still producing the harmless speech. Because the platform only observes $\lambda(y)$, a noisy signal of the speech's harmfulness, it must remove both harmful and harmless content that have the same $\lambda(y)$.

% Observe that \emph{along the $x$ axis of harmfulness}, the regulator's optimal behavior towards speakers \emph{is unchanged}. Strict liability is inefficient in the range $S < h(x) < P + S + \delta$, but threshold liability at $x^e$ defined by $h(x^e) = P + S + \delta$ is socially optimal. The regulator takes into account the value to the platform and to society at large.

% In other words, \emph{platform immunity rests on a related but distinct basis than speaker protections}. Both of them depend on positive externalities: when $\delta = 0$, the argument for a more speech-protective regime than strict liability collapses. But the pure speaker-protective argument is that some speech is valuable \emph{notwithstanding} the harms it causes, while the platform-protective argument is that some valuable speech is \emph{indistinguishable} from harmful speech.

% There are also good reasons to believe that in typical cases, the value $P$ extracted by a platform is significantly smaller than the value $S$ realized by the users who post content. Estimates of the net social utility created for platform users vastly exceed estimates of the platforms' revenues. This means that in practice, platforms have significantly weaker private incentives to host speech than orignal speakers do. Strict liability more significantly deters platforms than speakers.

% This is a standard argument for treating speech torts differently than other types of torts. Because the speaker creates value for listeners and for society by spreading information, the value of the speech \emph{to them} must be weighed against the harm that it causes. Thus, harmful true speech is frequently protected (e.g. negative consumer reviews). Similarly, the public-disclosure tort contains a First-Amendment-driven exception when the information is of legitimate public concern, i.e., when $\delta$ is high. 



% This model explains why speech law is more solicitous of speakers than of other actors. But notice that it cannot yet explain why speech law is even more solicitous of platforms than it is of speakers! The spillover critique of strict liability applies just as strongly to original speakers as it does to platforms. And the negligence strategy suggests that the threshold of liability should be based entirely on the overall \emph{social} costs and benefits of the speech: whatever that threshold is, it should apply equally to speakers and platforms, regardless of their private incentives. Something further is required to make sense of platform immunity.

% \section{Liability}

% Shutting down a platform is easier said than done. There are serious Constitutional barriers to directly prohibiting a platform, including especially the First Amendment. Regulators may also not be confident in their ability to assess the overall balance of costs and benefits from the content on the platform.

% For these reasons, it is more feasible to impose liability on platforms for the bad, i.e. illegal, content that they carry. Rather than being prohbiited entirely from operating, they are penalized if and only if they host content that society has chosen to prohibit. 



% \section{Filtering}

% Even better that shutting down a platform entirely merely because it has some bad content on it would be distinguishing the good content from the bad and removing the bad content while leaving up the good.  So ideally, from society's perspective, would be for platforms to implement filters that can distinguish wheat, sheep, and babies from chaff, goats, and bathwater.

% We model filtering by giving the platform a new option. It can distinguish between good and bad content at a cost of $C > 0$ per item. It must forego the revenue $R$ from any item of content that it removes, but otherwise blocking is costless. 

% Now the platform has three options instead of two. As before, it has the option of allowing all content to stay up for a total profit of $nR - nL\beta$. As before, it has the option of shutting down for a profit of $0$. It will still choose between them according to equation~\ref{shutdown1}, shutting down if $L$ is too high.



% Note that it is never rational for the platform to pay to examine content and then leave the bad items up. In the case where $R > L$, the platform is better off not paying $C$ at all and leaving the bad items up without even looking at them. So there are three options -- no filtering, filtering, and shutdown -- and not four.


% This might suggest that society should simply increase the liability $L$
% per bad item to the point at which a platform prefers to filter. But the platform's other option also functions as a constraint. If filtering is too expensive, the platform will prefer to shut down rather than bother. This constraint kicks in unless $nR\gamma - nC > 0$, i.e. when 
% \begin{equation}
% \label{shutdown2}
% R \;>\; C\frac{1}{1 - \beta}
% \end{equation}
% In words, unless the platform's revenue for each item of good content (all that it can leave up with filtering) exceeds its expected cost of filtering per item of good content, it is better off shutting down than filtering. This time the math of low-prevalence bad items cuts the other way, albeit not as strongly. If half of the items are bad, then its revenue must be greater than $2C$ for filtering to beat shutting down. But if one millionth of all items are bad, the platform's revenue per good item must be greater than about $1.000001C$. Notice that this value approaches from above a limit of $C$ as the prevalence of bad content decreases, and can never go below $C$. In the limit, if the platform's cost to filter per item exceeds its revenue per item --- if $C > R$ --- then it is never worthwhile for the platform to filter. It is better off just shutting down.

% These two constraints together mean that a high enough level of liability can force a platform to shut down.  

% What society ought to do, then, depends on the relative magnitudes of $\gamma$, $\beta$, $R$, $C$, $G$, and $B$. Filtering is a feasible option as long as $R > C/(1 - \beta)$. If so, then any level of liability $L > R + C/\beta$ will cause the platform to shift from leaving all content up to filtering.If filtering is unprofitable for the platform, then society must choose between no filtering and shutdown per equation \ref{shutdown1}.
